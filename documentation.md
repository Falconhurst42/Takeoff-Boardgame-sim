## What the program is meant to do:
> My family owns and enjoys a board game called "Take-off" in which players move a fleet of planes across a map of the world. However, whenever we play we get into an argument about how to play. We each want to impliment slightly more or less punishing rules to make the game a more managable length. My project attempts to put those arguments to rest by simulating many Take-off games (which are themselves a simulation of real planes) under different rule-sets and comparing the results

## What the program will need to do:
> To simulate a game the program will need
> - a `Game` object to store and handle the map (hash table), deck (queue), dice (function), and players (objects)
> - `Airport` structures to populate the map as spaces, track the connections between spaces, and track the location of planes
> - `Player` objects to store and handle `Airplane` objects as gameplay pieces. On their turn, the `Game` will tell a `Player` which actions they are allowed to take and a player must consider all the possibilites, choose the best one, and send those directions to the planes
> - `Airplane` objects to serve as piece which should handle their movements. `Players` will send Airplanes `Actions` which the Airplane must parse and execute: locating their destination and updating the location-tracking of their current (soon to be former) `Airport`, their destination `Airport`, and their own internal locaion tracking
> - Additional utlity structures such as `Color` and `Action` to hold common groupings of data and/or data designated for a particular role
> 
> A Game will require:
> - Game setup
> - A main gameplay loop
> 
> Game setup will require:
> - generating all `Players`, `Airplanes`, `Airports`, and connections between `Airports`, as well as initializing the map and deck
> 
> The main gameplay loop will involve:
> - Iterating through rounds
> - Iterating through `player's` turns
> - Rolling for `players` and sending them actions to use that turn
> - Keeping track of when `players` or the `game` are finished
> 
> Player's turns will involve
> - Simulating all possible movements with given `actions` and `airplanes`
> - Evaluating which set of movements is the best
> - Executing those movements by sending `actions` to the `airplanes`
> - Handling bumping other `player's` `airplanes`
> - Detecting when one or all of their `airplanes` have finished
