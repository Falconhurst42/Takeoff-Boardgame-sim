Names: Ethan
Project: Take Off (presentation 14)

Nice work! I like the motivation, I like how you tackled it. Good results.

## Deliverable

Couple of warnings on compile.

I think there are likely things to nit-pick, but overall this is great.

Only main thing is why do you have one file? This makes organization challenging. While things seem to be well organized, I don't think a ~1500 line file is very maintainable.

## Documentation

Good results section. I don't need to totally understand the context to still read what you were able to find. That is helpful.

"wildless simulations' wilder counterparts" lol, that is an amusing phrase.

You cover one of my critiques of the presentation in your section on Player AI. This is good.

## Presentation

It might have been more clear to concisely summarize the different choices for the player to take. This would influence what choices your agent was going to operate.

I appreciate your reflections. Over all, pretty good presentation.

### Presentation Feedback

#### What is one thing you really liked about this project?
* I like the different rules modifications that were implemented
* The implementation of features like the turns and bumps
* very detailed
* It's a really cool idea and sim
* I really like the whole system where the plane bumps with another.
* I liked that this was so connected to his actual life.
* I liked seeing the class hierarchy and how they interact with one another
* I like that you solved a real problem that you had
* That it applies to a board game, there are a lot of games out there with house rules and using a program on something like that is interesting
* I have never played or heard of the game takeoff, but I really liked how you took a game that you and your family enjoy and made it your own.
* I like the reason for this project.
* I like the element of bumping into another airplane in this simulation
* It is a problem i've never thought of, but its super cool to be able to simulate player movement
* I think it's a really interesting idea to simulate a game being played.
* I liked how you took the challenge of creating something that you knew would be difficult (i.e. the class structure) and figured out a way to make it work. I honestly would have ended up redesigning everything and giving up on my original design if I was in your place, good job persevering.
* I like how it simulates a real life game
* The explicit application of the simulation.
* The game sounds interesting and its cool how the AI works in the simulation
* Effective user input for playing the game.
* I have never heard of that game before, so the idea was unique and new to me. I liked the problem statement of finding out which things took the longest time.
* He solved a real problem his family had, turned something real into a computer program, very impressive.

#### What is one thing you would change / modify / add to the project?
* Not much to add here. maybe add more rules variants
* I will try simulating the game for an increased number of players
* label outputs from simulation
* An option to play the actual game itself
* I would record the results in a csv file format so you could give out graphs of your results later. This way, I can see the output of your results and how each different parameters affects it.
* I would add a rogue player that just tries to hurt other players.
* I would have liked to see more of an output
* It's hard to really understand the simulation fully without knowing the game, maybe the presentation could have a bit more explanation about the game?
* Maybe make a simulation of the board so that the code is interesting to watch
* One thing I would change is maybe the way the information is displayed just for ease of understanding what is happening.
* I would change variables to find a new set of rules that's even more efficient.
* I would add a computer player that makes a move based on your moves and the position on the map
* Updating player AI
* I like the idea of having different players with different play styles, I think that's something worth coming back to.
* Not sure if you already did this or not, but maybe add how different player strategies can affect performance as well? Just a thought.
* Add more realistic players. If you are trying to figure out an enjoyable experience for your family, optimal choices are likely not always going to be made due to human error.
* You already said this but adding a visual to aid in what is going on
* Not much that I could think of, you implemented a lot in a short amount of time.
* I would have tried to add more variation (like he was talking about) to the ai.
* Maybe a better demonstration of the original game to help viewers understand the use and connection of the simulation.

#### General feedback on the project? (Not required)
* This is a really good simulation and definetly could go further. Unfortunately for me, I do not understand all the nuances because of the limit of the presentations, however I can see clearly how it goes and works.
* Overall this was really cool. Would have been fun to watch it run and see how everything works, but I have seen what you can do in the past and have no doubt that it was really well thought out and well designed.
* Very creative and well executed.
* Pretty good.
* I hit the bell
